# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"

  about_contet: "This page is for optimizing a mana curve of Magic: The Gathering using computer simulation. This simulation helps you to get a deep insight into your deck and reach an ideal land construction. There are many kinds of research and simulations about mana curves, though few are capable of nonbasic lands. Is it useful theories or simulations for you that can't considers non-basic land ? I don't think so. So I try to create a simulation that can consider non-basic lands."
  about_simulation: "About Simulation"
  about_simulation_content: "It does not simulate an opponent. It does not throw hands if there were cards more than 7. It does not do Mulligan. It does not simulate spells (Which means ramp or draw or else are not simulated.) This simulation optimizes the total mana cost of spells plays each turn. Tap in lands is simulated. Slow lands and Pathway lands are simulated. Other types of lands are now developing."
  how_to_see: "How to see Result"
  propability_play_discription: "The probability of the card is played in X turn by the simulation. X equals the converted mana cost of the card. For example {1}{G} mana cost card, X is two. If simulations were performed 100 times, and the spells were played in two terns in each simulation 40 times, this probability is to be 40%. A parameter is 100 which equals the size of simulations. (which compose of times of players and not played). Hense, 60 times of not played are composed by the time that can't be drawn, that can't be played but drawn, that can't be played because played other spell."
  propability_play_if_draw_discription: "The probability of the card has been drawn before X turn and played in X turn by the simulation. The difference between play-probability is that play-probability-if-drawn is count the simulations the card had been drawn before X turn. Same above, suppose 100 simulations, the card played 40 times in turn 2, a parameter is to be 50 and probability 80%."
  propability_playability_if_draw_discription: "The probability of cards could be played in X turn by simulations.ã€ŒThe difference between play-probability-if-drawn is the inclusion in the numerator of the unplayed cards which have been drawn before turn 2. 50 times the card was drawn in 100 times simulations, 45 chances to play (because card is in a hand and sufficient lands are played), 40 times played,  then the probability is to be 90%."
  mana_curve_discription: "It represents a total mana cost that can play at each turn. If the deck is created with multiple colors. sum value equals the number of lands played in the turn. Each value equals the percentage. Suppose a deck composed of red and green mana, and the sum value was to be 1.8 in turn 2. It is represented that the total mana cost is 180 which can produce in turn 2 by red and green lands if 100 times simulations were done. And 100 times play red land and 80 green, for example, each value are 1 and 0.8."
